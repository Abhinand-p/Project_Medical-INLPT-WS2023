A clinical study, experimental animal models, and in vitro study are performed toevaluate the safety of a new drug. The limitations of these methods includeextensive time for toxicity testing, an ethical problem, and high costs ofexperimentation. Therefore computational methods are considered useful forestimating chemical toxicity. In silico toxicity prediction is one of thetoxicity assessments that uses computational methods to predict and stimulate thetoxicity of chemicals. In silico study aims to contribute to effectivedevelopment of new drug and chemical design. In this study, quantitativestructure-activity relationship (QSAR) models will be used to predict toxicitiesbased on chemical structural parameters. Because toxicities are complicatedphysiological phenomena, a similar toxicity expression might cause a differentpathway. Also, since many drugs with unknown mechanisms of actions are available,the application of artificial intelligence (AI)-which uses sophisticatedalgorithms- is increasingly used to predict toxicities. Recently, the QSAR modelwas applied to determine complex relations between chemical structures andtoxicities. However, accuracy of QSAR for toxicity prediction remains animportant issue. International competitions funded by public institutions canaddress this issue.

Typical ASD screeningtechniques are time consuming, so the early detection of ASD could reduce suchcosts and help limit the development of the condition. OBJECTIVE: We propose anautomated approach to detect autistic traits that replaces the scoring functionused in current ASD screening with a more intelligent and less subjectiveapproach. METHODS: The proposed approach employs deep neural networks (DNNs) todetect hidden patterns from previously labelled cases and controls, then appliesthe knowledge derived to classify the individual being screened. Specificity,sensitivity, and accuracy of the proposed approach are evaluated using ten-foldcross-validation. A comparative analysis has also been conducted to compare theDNNs' performance with other prominent machine learning algorithms. RESULTS:Results indicate that deep learning technologies can be embedded within existingASD screening to assist the stakeholders in the early identification of ASDtraits. CONCLUSION: The proposed system will facilitate access to needed supportfor the social, physical, and educational well-being of the patient and family bymaking ASD screening more intelligent and accurate.\", metadata={'source': './file.csv', 'row': 1}), Document(page_content='The Research in the field of mental health and educational needs of children with intellectual disabilities has increased over the years.

Transferlearning (TL) is a phenomenon that enables deep learning algorithms to overcomethe issue of shortage of training data in constructing an efficient model bytransferring knowledge from a given source task to a target task. However, inmost cases, ImageNet (natural images) pre-trained models that do not includemedical images, are utilized for transfer learning to medical images. Consideringthe utilization of microscopic cancer cell line images that can be acquired inlarge amount, we argue that learning from both natural and medical datasetsimproves performance in ultrasound breast cancer image classification. Theproposed multistage transfer learning (MSTL) algorithm was implemented usingthree pre-trained models: EfficientNetB2, InceptionV3, and ResNet50 with threeoptimizers: Adam, Adagrad, and stochastic gradient de-scent (SGD). Dataset sizesof 20,400 cancer cell images, 200 ultrasound images from Mendeley and 400ultrasound images from the MT-Small-Dataset were used. ResNet50-Adagrad-basedMSTL achieved a test accuracy of 99 +/- 0.612% on the Mendeley dataset and 98.7 +/-1.1% on the MT-Small-Dataset, averaging over 5-fold cross validation. A p-valueof 0.01191 was achieved when comparing MSTL against ImageNet based TL for theMendeley dataset.

Substantialvariation has been observed in pathologists' classification of colorectal polyps,and improved assessment by pathologists may be associated with reduced subsequentunderuse and overuse of colonoscopy. OBJECTIVE: To compare standard microscopicassessment with an artificial intelligence (AI)-augmented digital system thatannotates regions of interest within digitized polyp tissue and predicts polyptype using a deep learning model to assist pathologists in colorectal polypclassification. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this diagnostic studyconducted at a tertiary academic medical center and a community hospital in NewHampshire, 100 slides with colorectal polyp samples were read by 15 pathologistsusing a microscope and an AI-augmented digital system, with a washout period ofat least 12 weeks between use of each modality. The study was conducted fromFebruary 10 to July 10, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Accuracy and time ofevaluation were used to compare pathologists' performance when a microscope wasused with their performance when the AI-augmented digital system was used.Outcomes were compared using paired t tests and mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Inassessments of 100 slides with colorectal polyp specimens, use of theAI-augmented digital system significantly improved pathologists' classificationaccuracy compared with microscopic assessment from 73.9% (95% CI, 71.7%-76.2%) to80.8% (95% CI, 78.8%-82.8%) (P < .001). The overall difference in the evaluationtime per slide between the digital system (mean, 21.7 seconds; 95% CI, 20.8-22.7seconds) and microscopic examination (mean, 13.0 seconds; 95% CI, 12.4-13.5seconds) was -8.8 seconds (95% CI, -9.8 to -7.7 seconds), but this differencedecreased as pathologists became more familiar and experienced with the digitalsystem; the difference between the time of evaluation on the last set of 20slides for all pathologists when using the microscope and the digital system was4.8 seconds (95% CI, 3.0-6.5 seconds). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In thisdiagnostic study, an AI-augmented digital system significantly improved theaccuracy of pathologic interpretation of colorectal polyps compared withmicroscopic assessment. If applied broadly to clinical practice, this tool may beassociated with decreases in subsequent overuse and underuse of colonoscopy andthus with improved patient outcomes and reduced health care costs.\", metadata={'source': './file.csv', 'row': 4}), Document(page_content='The Research in the field of mental health and educational needs of children with intellectual disabilities has increased over the years.

Our IRB-approved study included 1367 serial CXRs from 405 adultpatients (mean age 65 +/- 16 years) from two sites in the US (Site A) and SouthKorea (Site B). We recorded information pertaining to patient demographics (age,gender), smoking history, comorbid conditions (such as cancer, cardiovascular andother diseases), vital signs (temperature, oxygen saturation), and availablelaboratory data (such as WBC count and CRP). Two thoracic radiologists performedthe qualitative assessment of all CXRs based on the RALE score for assessing theseverity of lung involvement. All CXRs were processed with a commercial AIalgorithm to obtain the percentage of the lung affected with findings related toCOVID-19 (AI score). Independent t- and chi-square tests were used in addition tomultiple logistic regression with Area Under the Curve (AUC) as output forpredicting disease outcome and the need for mechanical ventilation. The RALE andAI scores had a strong positive correlation in CXRs from each site(r(2) = 0.79-0.86; p < 0.0001). Patients who died or received mechanicalventilation had significantly higher RALE and AI scores than those with recoveryor without the need for mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001).

METHODS: This was an IRB-approvedretrospective multicentric study including patients with suspected PE fromSeptember to December 2019 (i.e., during a preliminary evaluation period of anapproved AI algorithm). CTPA quality and conclusions by emergency radiologistswere retrieved from radiological reports. The gold standard was a retrospectivereview of CTPA, radiological and clinical reports, AI outputs, and patientoutcomes. Diagnostic performance metrics for AI and radiologists were assessed inthe entire cohort and depending on CTPA quality. RESULTS: Overall, 1202 patientswere included (median age: 66.2 years). PE prevalence was 15.8% (190/1202). TheAI algorithm detected 219 suspicious PEs, of which 176 were true PEs, including19 true PEs missed by radiologists. In the cohort, the highest sensitivity andnegative predictive values (NPVs) were obtained with AI (92.6% versus 90% and98.6% versus 98.1%, respectively), while the highest specificity and positivepredictive value (PPV) were found with radiologists (99.1% versus 95.8% and 95%versus 80.4%, respectively). Accuracy, specificity, and PPV were significantlyhigher for radiologists except in subcohorts with poor-to-average injectionquality. Radiologists positively evaluated the AI algorithm to improve theirdiagnostic comfort (55/79 [69.6%]). CONCLUSION: Instead of replacingradiologists, AI for PE detection appears to be a safety net in emergencyradiology practice due to high sensitivity and NPV, thereby increasing theself-confidence of radiologists. KEY POINTS: * Both the AI algorithm andemergency radiologists showed excellent performance in diagnosing PE on CTPA(sensitivity and specificity >/= 90%; accuracy >/= 95%). * The AI algorithm for PEdetection can help increase the sensitivity and NPV of emergency radiologists inclinical practice, especially in cases of poor-to-moderate injection quality. *Emergency radiologists recommended the use of AI for PE detection in satisfactionsurveys to increase their confidence and comfort in their final diagnosis.', metadata={'source': './file.csv', 'row': 12}), Document(page_content='The Research in the field of mental health and educational needs of children with intellectual disabilities has increased over the years.

More than 50976 patients reported through published articles have receivedthe treatment of PKP. With the technique gradually improved, including puncture,bone cement infusion, vertebral expander instruments, diagnosis, and treatment ofspecial type of vertebral fractures, PKP is performed with the better efficacyand less complication. CONCLUSION: With the progression of minimally invasivespinal surgery around the world, PKP in China has been performed with a trendtowards a rapid, safe, and effective treatment. Digital, real-time and artificialintelligence are the directions of future development of PKP.

In this study, mean scores on self-reported complaints (measuredwith Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2-Restructured Form; MMPI-2-RF)and cognitive performance (measured with the Wechsler Adult IntelligenceScale-Third edition; WAIS-III; and the California Verbal Learning Test; CVLT) arecompared between two matched patient groups with severe (KS) and mildalcohol-related cognitive disorders or non KS (NKS). KS patients demonstratesignificantly lower scores on the WAIS-III indices and on the CVLT than thematched NKS group, and significantly higher scores on MMPI-2-RF validity scalesthat indicate denial of psychological complaints. Both groups are in the normalrange on MMPI-2-RF Cognitive Complaints (COG) and Neurological Complaints (NUC)scales compared with the normative sample. Finally, self-reported complaints andcognitive performance are not correlated significantly in both groups. Despitetheir alcohol-related cognitive impairments, both groups report no cognitivecomplaints at all indicating self-awareness impairment.

The underpinning concept is that angiogenic growthfactors or proangiogenic cells could be exploited therapeutically incardiovascular patients to enhance native revascularization responses to anischemic insult, thereby accelerating tissue healing. The initial enthusiasmgenerated by preclinical studies has been tempered by the modest success ofclinical trials assessing therapeutic angiogenesis. Similarly, proangiogenic celltherapy has so far not maintained the original promises. Intriguingly, thecurrent trend is to consider regeneration as a prerogative of the youngestorganism. Consequentially, the embryonic and foetal models are attracting muchattention for clinical translation into corrective modalities in the adulthood.Scientists seem to undervalue the lesson from Mother Nature, e.g. all humans areborn young but very few achieve the goal of an exceptional healthy longevity.Either natural experimentation is driven by a supreme intelligence or stochasticphenomena, one has to accept the evidence that healthy longevity is the fruit ofan evolutionary process lasting million years. It is therefore extremely likelythat results of this natural experimentation are more reliable and translatablethan the intensive, but very short human investigation on mechanisms governingrepair and regeneration. With this preamble in mind, here we propose to shift thefocus from the very beginning to the very end of human life and thus capture thesecret of prolonged health span to improve well-being in the adulthood.', metadata={'source': './file.csv', 'row': 15}), Document(page_content='The Research in the field of mental health and educational needs of children with intellectual disabilities has increased over the years.

Animal coronavirus research hasemphasized the importance of local mucosal protection (especially IgA) andsystemic responses. Animal model and human post-infection studies for SARS-CoVand MERS-CoV are largely corroborative. Whether for passive therapeuticstrategies or vaccination, these findings provide a template for COVID-19. Manyapproaches to vaccination have emerged, and there may be more than one vaccinethat will be applied, but individualized obstacles and concerns foradministration, efficacy, and safety are inevitable. Regardless of safeguards orpromises that may be understood from laboratory or vertebrate experiments,observations from large-scale human trials will ultimately prove to shape themedical future. Focus on common mucosal immunity can be underrated, and equallyor more, focus on lactogenic immunity may be underestimated.

In particular, articles publishedbefore the mid-1990 are available only in printed or scanned form. The extractionand storage of data from those articles in a publicly accessible database aredesirable, but doing this manually is a slow and error-prone process. In order toextract chemical structure depictions and convert them into a computer-readableformat, Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) tools were developed wherethe best performing OCSR tools are mostly rule-based. The DECIMER (Deep lEarningfor Chemical ImagE Recognition) project was launched to address the OCSR problemwith the latest computational intelligence methods to provide an automatedopen-source software solution. Various current deep learning approaches wereexplored to seek a best-fitting solution to the problem. In a preliminarycommunication, we outlined the prospect of being able to predict SMILES encodingsof chemical structure depictions with about 90% accuracy using a dataset of50-100 million molecules. In this article, the new DECIMER model is presented, atransformer-based network, which can predict SMILES with above 96% accuracy fromdepictions of chemical structures without stereochemical information and above89% accuracy for depictions with stereochemical information.', metadata={'source': './file.csv', 'row': 17}), Document(page_content='The Research in the field of mental health and educational needs of children with intellectual disabilities has increased over the years.

While therapeuticstrategies for stage I, III, and IV CC are standardized, those for stage II CCremain debatable. The choice of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage IICC depends on stage (pT4) and grade (high) of the disease, the presence ofvenous, perinervous, and/or lymphatic emboli, or the need of suboptimal surgery(tumor with initial occlusion or perforation needing emergency surgeries, <12lymph nodes harvested). Several prognostic factors that have been validated inretrospective studies can potentially define a population of CC patients at lowand high-risk for reccurence.

A novelconceptual approach-the empathic agent paradigm (EAP)-provided the theoreticalfoundation. The EAP results in a veridical, logically defensible scoring key, amajor development for the assessment of EI, which otherwise has relied on lessdefensible approaches. Validity evidence for test score interpretations of theEmpathic Agent Paradigm Test (EAPT) was subsequently obtained in two studies. InStudy 1, participants (N = 321) completed the EAPT (alpha = .72 at testlet level),along with measures of classical intelligence, the Big Five personality traits,and a situational judgment measure of EU. This study provides factorial,convergent, and discriminant validity evidence for EAPT test scoreinterpretations. In Study 2 (N = 158), an important assumption about the responseprocesses in the EAPT was verified experimentally, in the process providingfurther validity evidence for test score interpretations.

A recent study has shown that chronic fluoride exposure duringchildhood can affect cognitive function and decrease intelligence quotient, butthe mechanism of this phenomenon is still incomplete. Extracellular matrix (ECM)and its enzymes are one of the key players of neuroplasticity which is essentialfor cognitive function development. Changes in the structure and the functioningof synapses are caused, among others, by ECM enzymes. These enzymes, especiallymatrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs), areinvolved in both physiological processes, such as learning or memory, andpathological processes like glia scare formation, brain tissue regeneration,brain-blood barrier damage and inflammation. Therefore, in this study, weexamined the changes in gene and protein expression of MMP2, MMP9, TIMP2 andTIMP3 in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum of rats(Wistar) exposed to relatively low F doses (50 mg/L in drinking water) during thepre- and neonatal period. We found that exposure to F during pre- and postnatalperiod causes a change in the mRNA and protein level of MMP2, MMP9, TIMP2 andTIMP3 in the prefrontal cortex, striatum, hippocampus and cerebellum. Thesechanges may be associated with many disorders that are observed during Fintoxication.

Previous assessment techniques useeither \"\"conventional CVD risk calculators (CCVRC)\"\" or machine learning (ML)paradigms. These techniques are ad-hoc, unreliable, not fully automated, and havevariabilities. We, therefore, introduce AtheroEdge-MCDL(AI) (AE3.0(DL))windows-based platform using multiclass Deep Learning (DL) system. METHODS: Datawas collected on 500 patients having both carotid ultrasound and correspondingcoronary angiography scores (CAS), measured as stenosis in coronary arteries andconsidered as the gold standard. A total of 39 covariates were used, clubbed intothree clusters, namely (i) Office-based: age, gender, body mass index, smoker,hypertension, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure; (ii)Laboratory-based: Hyperlipidemia, hemoglobin A1c, and estimated glomerularfiltration rate; and (iii) Carotid ultrasound image phenotypes: maximum plaqueheight, total plaque area, and intra-plaque neovascularization. Baselinecharacteristics for four classes (target labels) having significant (p < 0.0001)values were calculated using Chi-square and ANOVA. For handling the cohort\\'simbalance in the risk classes, AE3.0(DL) used the synthetic minorityover-sampling technique (SMOTE). AE3.0(DL) used Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) DL models and the performance (accuracy andarea-under-the-curve) was computed using 10-fold cross-validation (90% training,10% testing) frameworks.

METHODS: In a cohort of 253 pregnantwomen and their children from Cincinnati, OH (enrolled 2003-2006), we quantifiedbiomarker concentrations of 43 metals, phthalates, phenols, polybrominateddiphenyl ethers, organophosphate and organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinatedbiphenyls, perfluoroalkyl substances, and environmental tobacco smoke in blood orurine. Using k-means clustering and principal component (PC) analysis, wecharacterized chemical mixtures among pregnant women. We assessed children'scognitive abilities using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale ofIntelligence-III and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV at ages 5 and 8years, respectively. We estimated covariate-adjusted differences in children'scognitive ability scores ]=cross clusters, and with increasing PC scores andindividual biomarker concentrations. RESULTS: Geometric mean biomarkerconcentrations were generally highest, intermediate, and lowest among women inclusters 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Children born to women in clusters 1 and 2had 5.1 (95% CI: 9.4,-0.8) and 2.0 (95% CI: 5.5, 1,4) lower performance IQ scorescompared to children in cluster 3, respectively. PC scores and individualchemical biomarker concentrations were not associated with cognitive abilities.CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, combined prenatal exposure to phenols, certainphthalates, pesticides, and perfluoroalkyl substances was inversely associatedwith children's cognition, but some individual chemical biomarker concentrationswere not.

To extend research in this area, the researchers explored andanalysed the academic articles published within the mentioned scope. Thus, inthis paper a systematic review is carried out to map and draw the researchscenery for EEG human emotion into a taxonomy. Systematically searched allarticles about the, EEG human emotion based music in three main databases:ScienceDirect, Web of Science and IEEE Xplore from 1999 to 2016. These databasesfeature academic studies that used EEG to measure brain signals, with a focus onthe effects of music on human emotions. The screening and filtering of articleswere performed in three iterations. In the first iteration, duplicate articleswere excluded. In the second iteration, the articles were filtered according totheir titles and abstracts, and articles outside of the scope of our domain wereexcluded. In the third iteration, the articles were filtered by reading the fulltext and excluding articles outside of the scope of our domain and which do notmeet our criteria. Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 100 articles wereselected and separated into five classes. The first class includes 39 articles(39%) consists of emotion, wherein various emotions are classified usingartificial intelligence (AI). The second class includes 21 articles (21%) iscomposed of studies that use EEG techniques. This class is named 'braincondition'. The third class includes eight articles (8%) is related to featureextraction, which is a step before emotion classification. That this processmakes use of classifiers should be noted. However, these articles are not listedunder the first class because these eight articles focus on feature extractionrather than classifier accuracy. The fourth class includes 26 articles (26%)comprises studies that compare between or among two or more groups to identifyand discover human emotion-based EEG. The final class includes six articles (6%)represents articles that study music as a stimulus and its impact on brainsignals. Then, discussed the five main categories which are action types, age ofthe participants, and number size of the participants, duration of recording andlistening to music and lastly countries or authors' nationality that publishedthese previous studies. it afterward recognizes the main characteristics of thispromising area of science in: motivation of using EEG process for measuring humanbrain signals, open challenges obstructing employment and recommendations toimprove the utilization of EEG process.\", metadata={'source': './file.csv', 'row': 29}), Document(page_content='The Research in the field of mental health and educational needs of children with intellectual disabilities has increased over the years.

We postulated that specific risk factors for post-CC transientdisturbance of consciousness (pCTDC) are associated with CC. The purpose of thisstudy was to review patients with intractable epilepsy who underwent CC and tostatistically analyze risk factors for pCTDC. METHODS: Inclusion criteria forpatients who underwent CC between January 2009 and November 2019 were: (1)>/=2â€¯years old and (2) followed up for more than 8â€¯months. The state ofconsciousness before and after CC was evaluated with the Glasgow coma scale. Westatistically assessed predictors for pCTDC as the primary outcome. RESULTS:Fifty-six patients (19 females, 37 males) were enrolled, and the age range was2-57â€¯years old. Thirty-seven (66.1%) patients developed pCTDC. The mean periodfrom the beginning of the state of pCTDC to recovery to their baseline consciouslevel was 4.9â€¯days (range: 2-25â€¯days).

The theory ofcreative paradoxical functional facilitation (PFF) assumes that disinhibitedfrontal lobe function can enhance creative abilities. The aim of the currentstudy was to explore our hypothesis that JME is associated with higher artisticcreativity based on the theory of PFF. METHODS: We assessed 25 patients with JMEaged 18 to 40years in regard to neuropsychological creativity testing. Resultswere compared with those of 25 age-, sex-, and level of education-matched healthycontrol subjects (HC) and patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Creativeabilities were assessed using two validated and standardized tests: 1) nonverbal:the incomplete figure task of Torrance Test of Creative Thinking and 2) verbal:verbal creativity test. Additionally, a basic assessment of fluid intelligence(test for problem solving) and frontal lobe function (trail-making test) wasadministered to all participants. RESULTS: Verbal creativity was impaired in bothgroups with epilepsy compared with that in HC (specific score: JME vs. HC,p=0.008; TLE vs. HC, p=0.003). In regard to nonverbal creative abilities, bothgroups with epilepsy exhibited fair performance. Level of fluid intelligence waseven in all groups (p=0.433). Only patients with JME showed deficits in thefrontal lobe test of psychomotor speed (time in seconds: 67.7 JME vs. 54.6 TLEvs. 52.8 HC; p=0.045).

Initially, CT imaging was demonstrated to be one of the most sensitive tests for the detection ofinfection. Currently, with broader availability of polymerase chain reaction fordisease diagnosis, CT is mainly used for the identification of complications andother defined clinical indications in hospitalized patients. Nonetheless,radiologists are interpreting lung imaging in unsuspected patients as well as insuspected patients with imaging obtained to rule out other relevant clinicalindications.

The components of g, fluid (Gf) andcrystallized (Gc) reasoning, exhibit distinct trajectories of age-related change.Because the brain also ages differentially, we hypothesized that age-relatedcognitive and neural changes would be coupled. In a sample of healthy middle-agedand older adults, we examined changes in Gf (operationalized by Cattell CultureFair Test) and Gc (indexed by two vocabulary tests) as well as in structuralproperties of 19 brain regions. We fitted linear mixed models to the datacollected on 73 healthy adults who participated in baseline assessment, with 43returning for at least one follow-up, and 16 of them contributing four repeatedassessments over seven years. We observed age differences as well as longitudinaldecline in Gf, contrasted to a lack of age differences and stability in Gc.Cortical thickness and cortical volume exhibited significant age differences andlongitudinal declines, which were accelerated in P-FIT regions. Gf (but not Gc)was associated with cortical thickness, but no such relationship was found forcortical volume.

While radiological characterization of the morphologicalstenosis grade can aid in the diagnosis, it may not always correlate with patientsymptoms. Artificial intelligence (AI) may diagnose symptomatic LSS in patientssolely based on self-reported history questionnaires. METHODS: We evaluatedmultiple machine learning (ML) models to determine the likelihood of LSS using aself-reported questionnaire in patients experiencing low back pain and/ornumbness in the legs. The questionnaire was built from peer-reviewed literatureand a multidisciplinary panel of experts. Random forest, lasso logisticregression, support vector machine, gradient boosting trees, deep neuralnetworks, and automated machine learning models were trained and performancemetrics compared. RESULTS: Data from 4,827 patients (4,690 patients without LSS:mean age 62.44, range 27 - 84 years, 62.8% females, and 137 patients with LSS:mean age 50.59, range 30 - 71 years, 59.9% females) were retrospectivelycollected. Among the evaluated models, the random forest model demonstrated thehighest predictive accuracy with an area under the receiver operatingcharacteristic curve (AUROC) between model prediction and LSS diagnosis of 0.96,a sensitivity of 0.94, a specificity of 0.88, a balanced accuracy of 0.91 and aCohen's kappa of 0.85. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that ML can automate thediagnosis of LSS based on self-reported questionnaires with high accuracy.Implementation of standardized and intelligence-automated workflow may serve as asupportive diagnostic tool to streamline patient management and potentially lowerhealthcare costs.\", metadata={'source': './file.csv', 'row': 46}), Document(page_content='The Research in the field of mental health and educational needs of children with intellectual disabilities has increased over the years.

In the Thinking Healthy Programmecluster-randomised controlled trial, a perinatal depression intervention wasassessed in Pakistan in 2006-07. The intervention significantly reduceddepression levels 12 months post partum compared with a control. We aimed toassess the effect of this same intervention on the cognitive, socioemotional, andphysical development of children at around age 7 years. METHODS: Mother-childdyads who participated in the Thinking Healthy Programme cluster-randomisedcontrolled trial were interviewed when the index child was about 7 years old. Areference group of 300 mothers who did not have prenatal depression and,therefore, did not receive the original intervention, was enrolled with theirchildren at the same time. The primary cognitive outcome was the score on theWechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI-IV); primarysocioemotional outcomes included scores on the Strengths and DifficultiesQuestionnaire (SDQ) and the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS); and primaryphysical outcomes were height-for-age, weight-for-age, and body-mass index(BMI)-for-age Z scores. Generalised linear modelling with random effects toaccount for clustering was the main method of analysis. Analyses were byintention to treat. The Thinking Healthy Programme cluster-randomised trial wasregistered at ISRCTN.com, number ISRCTN65316374. FINDINGS: Of 705 participatingmother-child dyads interviewed at the end of the Thinking Healthy Programmerandomised controlled trial, 584 (83%) dyads were enrolled. 289 mothers hadreceived the intervention and 295 had received a control consisting of enhancedusual care. The mean age of the children was 7.6 years (SD 0.1). Overall,cognitive, socioemotional, or physical development outcomes did not differbetween children in the intervention or control groups whose mothers had prenataldepression. When compared with the reference group of children whose mothers didnot have prenatal depression, the Thinking Healthy Programme trial children hadworse socioemotional outcomes; mean scores were significantly higher on the SDQfor total difficulty (11.34 vs 10.35; mean difference 0.78, 95% CI 0.09-1.47;p=0.03) and on the SCAS for anxiety (21.33 vs 17.57; mean difference 2.93,1.15-4.71; p=0.0013). Cognitive and physical outcomes did not differ.INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that cognitive, socioemotional, and physicaldevelopmental outcomes of children at age 7 years whose mother had prenataldepression did not differ between those who received the Thinking HealthyProgramme intervention and those who received the control. Further investigationis needed to understand what types of complex interventions or approaches areneeded for long-term gains in maternal and child wellbeing.

However, the present design process of splints is time-consuming and has lowreproducibility. To solve these problems, an algorithm for artificial intelligentsplints has been developed in this study, making the automatic design of splintsaccessible. METHODS: Firstly, the algorithm and program of the artificialintelligence splint were created. Then a total of 54 patients with skeletal classIII malocclusion were included in this study from 2018 to 2020. Pre andpostoperative radiographic examinations were performed. The cephalometricmeasurements were recorded and the difference between virtual simulation andpostoperative images was measured. The time cost and differences betweenartificial intelligent splints and digital splints were analyzed through bothmodel surgery and radiographic images. RESULTS: The results showed that theefficiency of designing splints is significantly improved. And the meandifference between artificial intelligent splints and digital splints was<0.15 mm in model surgery.

A deeper understanding of its underlying pathophysiologies mayprovide an opportunity for earlier detection and therapeutic intervention.Previous approaches for characterizing AD were targeted at single aspects of thedisease. Yet, due to the complex nature of AD, the success of these approacheswas limited. However, in recent years, advancements in integrative diseasemodeling, built on a wide range of AD biomarkers, have taken a global view on thedisease, facilitating more comprehensive analysis and interpretation. IntegrativeAD models can be sorted in two primary types, namely hypothetical models anddata-driven models. The latter group split into two subgroups: (i) Models thatuse traditional statistical methods such as linear models, (ii) Models that takeadvantage of more advanced artificial intelligence approaches such as machinelearning. While many integrative AD models have been published over the lastdecade, their impact on clinical practice is limited. There exist majorchallenges in the course of integrative AD modeling, namely data missingness andcensoring, imprecise human-involved priori knowledge, model reproducibility,dataset interoperability, dataset integration, and model interpretability.

Although the emotional difficulties inalexithymia are well established, to date little work has examined itsrelationship to broader cognitive abilities, such as general intelligence. Acrossthree independent, healthy adult samples (Ns = 389, 318, & 273), we examinedwhether alexithymia was associated with general intelligence. In all threesamples, we observed a significant negative association between alexithymia andgeneral intelligence. In two of the samples, general intelligence was asignificant predictor of alexithymia even when accounting for performance ontests of facial emotion recognition ability and supramodal emotion recognitionability (measured with faces, bodies, and voices).

To develop a successfulformulation, drug release from a polymeric matrix and subsequent biodegradationneed to be achieved. In this study, we focus on combining microfluidic andartificial intelligence (AI) technologies, alongside using biomaterials, togenerate drug-loaded polymeric microparticles (MPs). Our strategy is based onusing Poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) as a biodegradable polymer for thegeneration of a controlled drug delivery vehicle, with IND as an example of apoorly soluble drug, a 3D flow focusing microfluidic chip as a simple devicesynthesis particle, and machine learning using artificial neural networks (ANNs)as an in silico tool to generate and predict size-tunable PLGA MPs. The influenceof different polymer concentrations and the flow rates of dispersed andcontinuous phases on PLGA droplet size prediction in a microfluidic platform wereassessed. Subsequently, the developed ANN model was utilized as a quick guide togenerate PLGA MPs at a desired size. After conditions optimization, IND-loadedPLGA MPs were produced, and showed larger droplet sizes than blank MPs. Further,the proposed microfluidic system is capable of producing monodisperse particleswith a well-controllable shape and size.

In the past few years, neural network-based methodshave shown impressive performance for TFP. However, most of previous studies failto explicitly and effectively model the relationship between inflows andoutflows. Consequently, these methods are usually uninterpretable and inaccurate.In this paper, we propose an interpretable local flow attention (LFA) mechanismfor TFP, which yields three advantages. (1) LFA is flow-aware. Different fromexisting works, which blend inflows and outflows in the channel dimension, weexplicitly exploit the correlations between flows with a novel attentionmechanism. (2) LFA is interpretable. It is formulated by the truisms of trafficflow, and the learned attention weights can well explain the flow correlations.(3) LFA is efficient. Instead of using global spatial attention as in previousstudies, LFA leverages the local mode. The attention query is only performed onthe local related regions. This not only reduces computational cost but alsoavoids false attention. Based on LFA, we further develop a novel spatiotemporalcell, named LFA-ConvLSTM (LFA-based convolutional long short-term memory), tocapture the complex dynamics in traffic data. Specifically, LFA-ConvLSTM consistsof three parts. (1) A ConvLSTM module is utilized to learn flow-specificfeatures. (2) An LFA module accounts for modeling the correlations between flows.(3) A feature aggregation module fuses the above two to obtain a comprehensivefeature. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that our methodachieves a better prediction performance. We improve the RMSE metric by3.2%-4.6%, and the MAPE metric by 6.2%-6.7%.

Businessleaders are grappling with dysfunctional business models that are ill-equipped tomanage the disruptive environment of growing artificial intelligence. Hence, thisstudy examined the discontinuous shift in the scope and culture of businessmodels by exploring interdisciplinary streams of literature. An integrativereview methodology was used in this study to develop theoretical constructsrelating to business model innovation in the services sector. Key propositionswere an innovation continuum, a responsive business innovation model and valuearchitecture, which inculcates a sustainable value creation proposition andmarket advantage. Businesses must continuously evolve on the high end of theinnovation continuum to reduce the risk of innovation apathy and strategicmyopia. A key contribution of this study was the interdependencies in valuenetworks that allow for collaborative working and co-creation of resources, suchas crowdsourcing, crowdworking and social media platforms. This study also showedthe growing importance of a centre of excellence to function at the forefront ofdisruptive technologies. A key finding was the need for governance structures torecognise and manage the trade-offs between value drivers, which sometimes mayconflict with societal benefits.

Recent studies suggest that big GNN modelspre-trained by self-supervised learning on unlabeled datasets enable bettertransfer performance in downstream molecular property prediction tasks. However,the approaches in these studies require multiple complex self-supervised tasksand large-scale datasets , which are time-consuming, computationally expensiveand difficult to pre-train end-to-end. Here, we design a simple yet effectiveself-supervised strategy to simultaneously learn local and global informationabout molecules, and further propose a novel bi-branch masked graph transformerautoencoder (BatmanNet) to learn molecular representations. BatmanNet featurestwo tailored complementary and asymmetric graph autoencoders to reconstruct themissing nodes and edges, respectively, from a masked molecular graph. With thisdesign, BatmanNet can effectively capture the underlying structure and semanticinformation of molecules, thus improving the performance of molecularrepresentation.

The development of orthotopic mouse models of lung cancer, which recapitulates thedisease more realistically compared to the widely used subcutaneous tumor models,is expected to critically aid the development of novel therapies to battle lungcancer or related comorbidities such as cachexia. However, follow-up of tumortake, tumor growth and detection of therapeutic effects is difficult, timeconsuming and requires a vast number of animals in orthotopic models. Here, wedescribe a solution for the fully automatic segmentation and quantification oforthotopic lung tumor volume and mass in whole-body mouse computed tomography(CT) scans. The goal is to drastically enhance the efficiency of the researchprocess by replacing time-consuming manual procedures with fast, automated ones.A deep learning algorithm was trained on 60 unique manually delineated lungtumors and evaluated by four-fold cross validation. Quantitative performancemetrics demonstrated high accuracy and robustness of the deep learning algorithmfor automated tumor volume analyses (mean dice similarity coefficient of 0.80),and superior processing time (69 times faster) compared to manual segmentation.Moreover, manual delineations of the tumor volume by three independent annotatorswas sensitive to bias in human interpretation while the algorithm was lessvulnerable to bias. In addition, we showed that besides longitudinalquantification of tumor development, the deep learning algorithm can also be usedin parallel with the previously published method for muscle mass quantificationand to optimize the experimental design reducing the number of animals needed inpreclinical studies.

CM is associated with a characteristicmalarial retinopathy (MR) with diagnostic and prognostic significance. Advancesin retinal imaging have allowed researchers to better characterize the changesseen in MR and to make inferences about the pathophysiology of the disease. Thestudy aimed to explore the role of retinal imaging in diagnosis andprognostication in CM; establish insights into pathophysiology of CM from retinalimaging; establish future research directions. METHODS: The literature wassystematically reviewed using the African Index Medicus, MEDLINE, Scopus and Webof Science databases. A total of 35 full texts were included in the finalanalysis. The descriptive nature of the included studies and heterogeneityprecluded meta-analysis. RESULTS: Available research clearly shows retinalimaging is useful both as a clinical tool for the assessment of CM and as ascientific instrument to aid the understanding of the condition. Modalities whichcan be performed at the bedside, such as fundus photography and optical coherencetomography, are best positioned to take advantage of artificialintelligence-assisted image analysis, unlocking the clinical potential of retinalimaging for real-time diagnosis in low-resource environments where extensivelytrained clinicians may be few in number, and for guiding adjunctive therapies asthey develop.

We aim to evaluate whether radiomicsfeatures of CMR cine images vary during the cardiac cycle and investigate thereproducibility of radiomics features of CMR cine images. METHODS: Thisretrospective study enrolled 59 healthy adults who underwent CMR examination. Twoobservers segmented the myocardium on a 4D stack of three consecutivemid-ventricular short-axis cine images covering the cardiac cycle. A total of 352radiomics features were extracted. The coefficient of variation and intraclasscorrelation coefficient were used to assess the feature variability through thecycle and inter-observer reproducibility, respectively. RESULTS: Approximately55% of radiomics features showed large variability through the cardiac cycle. Theoriginal features showed more variability than the Laplacian of Gaussian-filteredfeatures (73.8% vs. 48%). The features of 4D stack cine images had a higherproportion of reproducible features (92.0%, 87.7%, and 76.1%) compared with theend-diastolic (77.8%, 62.2%, and 41.7%) and the end-systolic images (81.5%,74.1%, and 58.8%) for intraclass correlation cut-off values of (3)0.80, > 0.85,and > 0.90, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Radiomics features of CMR cine imagesgreatly vary during the cardiac cycle. The radiomics features of 4D stack of cineimages are more robust compared with end-diastolic and end-systolic cine imagesin terms of reproducibility. The impact of the cardiac cycle on thereproducibility of the features should be considered when employing CMR cineimages radiomics.

Meanwhile,current studies of formula recommendation only focus on the observable clinicalsymptoms and lack of molecular information. Here, inspired by the theory of TCMnetwork pharmacology, we propose an intelligent formula recommendation systembased on deep learning (FordNet), fusing the information of phenotype andmolecule. We collected more than 20,000 electronic health records from TCM MasterLi Jiren\\'s experience from 2013 to March 2020. In the FordNet system, the featureof diagnosis description is extracted by convolution neural network and thefeature of TCM formula is extracted by network embedding, which fusing themolecular information.

The Improving Global Health (IGH) Fellowship scheme is one suchprogramme, it provides a unique leadership development opportunity through anoverseas placement with a focus on quality improvement work. This evaluationexamines the impact of completing an IGH Fellowship on the career and leadershipdevelopment of participants, who are referred to as Fellows. METHODS: Fellows whohad returned from overseas placement between August 2008 and February 2015 wereinvited to complete an anonymised online questionnaire, which collectedinformation on: demographic details, motivations for applying to the programme,leadership development and the impact of the IGH Fellowship on their career.Fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted to further explore the impactof the programme on Fellows\\' leadership development and career progression.Interview transcripts were manually coded and underwent thematic contentanalysis. RESULTS: The questionnaire had a 67% (74/111) response rate. The numberof fellows who self-identified as a leader more than doubled on completion of theIGH Fellowship (24/74 pre-fellowship versus 58/74 post-fellowship). 74% (55/74)reported that the IGH Fellowship had an impact upon their career, 35 of whichreported that the impact was \"\"substantial\"\". The themes that emerged from theinterviews revealed a personal development cycle that consolidated the fellows\\'interests and values whilst enhancing their self-efficacy and subsequentlyimpacted positively upon their career choices. Three interviewees expressedfrustration at the lack of opportunity to utilise their new skills on returningto the United Kingdom (UK). CONCLUSIONS: The IGH Fellowship successfullyempowered healthcare professionals to self-identify as leaders. Of the 45/74respondents who commented on the impact of the IGH Fellowship on their career,41/45 comments were positive. The fellows described a process of experientiallearning, reflection and evolving cultural intelligence, which consolidated theirinterests and values.

One such critically needed solution is the prediction ofhealth-relevant ambient ground-level air pollution concentrations. However, manychallenges exist surrounding the size and representativeness of limited groundreference stations for model development, reconciling multi-source data, andinterpretability of deep learning models. This research addresses thesechallenges by leveraging a strategically deployed, extensive low-cost sensor(LCS) network that was rigorously calibrated through an optimized neural network.A set of raster predictors with varying data quality and spatial scales wasretrieved and processed, including gap-filled satellite aerosol optical depthproducts and airborne LiDAR-derived 3D urban form. We developed a multi-scale,attention-enhanced convolutional neural network model to reconcile the LCSmeasurements and multi-source predictors for estimating daily PM(2.5)concentration at 30-m resolution. This model employs an advanced approach byusing the geostatistical kriging method to generate a baseline pollution patternand a multi-scale residual method to identify both regional patterns andlocalized events for high-frequency feature retention. We further usedpermutation tests to quantify the feature importance, which has rarely been donein DL applications in environmental science. Finally, we demonstrated oneapplication of the model by investigating the air pollution inequality issueacross and within various urbanization levels at the block group scale.

In order to achieve large-scale cataract screening and remarkable performance, severalstudies have applied artificial intelligence (AI) to cataract detection based onfundus images. However, the fundus images they used are original from normaloptical circumstances, which is less impractical due to the existence ofpoor-quality fundus images for inappropriate optical conditions in actualscenarios. Furthermore, these poor-quality images are easily mistaken ascataracts because both show fuzzy imaging characteristics, which may decline theperformance of cataract detection. Therefore, we aimed to develop and validate anantiinterference AI model for rapid and efficient diagnosis based on fundusimages. Materials and Methods: The datasets (including both cataract andnoncataract labels) were derived from the Chinese PLA general hospital. Theantiinterference AI model consisted of two AI submodules, a quality recognitionmodel for cataract labeling and a convolutional neural networks-based model forcataract classification. The quality recognition model was performed todistinguish poor-quality images from normal-quality images and further generatethe pseudo labels related to image quality for noncataract. Through this, theoriginal binary-class label (cataract and noncataract) was adjusted to threecategories (cataract, noncataract with normal-quality images, and noncataractwith poor-quality images), which could be used to guide the model to distinguishcataract from suspected cataract fundus images. In the cataract classificationstage, the convolutional-neural-network-based model was proposed to classifycataracts based on the label of the previous stage. The performance of the modelwas internally validated and externally tested in real-world settings, and theevaluation indicators included area under the receiver operating curve (AUC),accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), and specificity (SPE). Results: In theinternal and external validation, the antiinterference AI model showed robustperformance in cataract diagnosis (three classifications with AUCs >91%, ACCs>84%, SENs >71%, and SPEs >89%). Compared with the model that was trained on thebinary-class label, the antiinterference cataract model improved its performanceby 10%.

However, manualtumor delineation remains laborious and challenging due to radiologicalcomplexity. The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of theHD-GLIO tool, an ensemble of pre-trained deep learning models based on thennUNet-algorithm, for tumor segmentation, response prediction, and its potentialfor clinical deployment. METHODS: We analyzed the predicted contrast-enhanced(CE) and non-enhancing (NE) HD-GLIO output in 49 multi-parametric MRIexaminations from 23 grade-4 glioma patients. The volumes were retrospectivelycompared to corresponding manual delineations by 2 independent operators, beforeprospectively testing the feasibility of clinical deployment of HD-GLIO-output toa RT setting. RESULTS: For CE, median Dice scores were 0.81 (95% CI 0.71-0.83)and 0.82 (95% CI 0.74-0.84) for operator-1 and operator-2, respectively. For NE,median Dice scores were 0.65 (95% CI 0.56-0,69) and 0.63 (95% CI 0.57-0.67),respectively. Comparing volume sizes, we found excellent intra-class correlationcoefficients of 0.90 (P < .001) and 0.95 (P < .001), for CE, respectively, and0.97 (P < .001) and 0.90 (P < .001), for NE, respectively. Moreover, there was astrong correlation between response assessment in Neuro-Oncology volumes andHD-GLIO-volumes (P < .001, Spearman's R(2) = 0.83).

Nonetheless, achieving a pragmatic andecological validation of medical AI systems in real-world settings is difficult,even when these systems exhibit very high accuracy in laboratory settings. Thisdifficulty has been called the \"\"last mile of implementation.\"\" In this review ofthe concept, we claim that this metaphorical mile presents two chasms: the hiatusof human trust and the hiatus of machine experience. The former hiatusencompasses all that can hinder the concrete use of AI at the point of care,including availability and usability issues, but also the contradictory phenomenaof cognitive ergonomics, such as automation bias (overreliance on technology) andprejudice against the machine (clearly the opposite). The latter hiatus, on theother hand, relates to the production and availability of a sufficient amount ofreliable and accurate clinical data that is suitable to be the \"\"experience\"\" withwhich a machine can be trained. In briefly reviewing the existing literature, wefocus on this latter hiatus of the last mile, as it has been largely neglected byboth ML developers and doctors. In doing so, we argue that efforts to cross thischasm require data governance practices and a focus on data work, including thepractices of data awareness and data hygiene. To address the challenge ofbridging the chasms in the last mile of medical AI implementation, we discuss thesix main socio-technical challenges that must be overcome in order to buildrobust bridges and deploy potentially effective AI in real-world clinicalsettings.', metadata={'source': './file.csv', 'row': 79}), Document(page_content=\"The Research in the field of mental health and educational needs of children with intellectual disabilities has increased over the years.

The development of cardinal knowledge is related to one ortwo core, inherent systems - the approximate number system (ANS) and the objecttracking system (OTS) - but whether these systems act alone, in concert, orantagonistically is debated. Longitudinal assessments of 198 preschool childrenon OTS, ANS, and cardinality tasks enabled testing of two single-mechanism(ANS-only and OTS-only) and two dual-mechanism models, controlling forintelligence, executive functions, preliteracy skills, and demographic factors.Measures of both OTS and ANS predicted cardinal knowledge in concert early in theschool year, inconsistent with single-mechanism models. The ANS but not the OTSpredicted cardinal knowledge later in the school year as well the acquisition ofthe cardinal principle, a critical shift in cardinal understanding. The resultssupport a Merge model, whereby both systems initially contribute to children'searly mapping of number words to cardinal value, but the role of the OTSdiminishes over time while that of the ANS continues to support cardinalknowledge as children come to understand the counting principles.\", metadata={'source': './file.csv', 'row': 80}), Document(page_content=\"The Research in the field of mental health and educational needs of children with intellectual disabilities has increased over the years.

In particular,graph data analysis and graph data mining play an important role in biologyinteraction networks, where recent techniques of artificial intelligence, usuallyemployed in other type of networks (e.g., social, citations, and trademarknetworks) aim to implement various data mining tasks including classification,clustering, recommendation, anomaly detection, and link prediction. Thecommitment and efforts of artificial intelligence research in network biology aremotivated by the fact that machine learning techniques are often prohibitivelycomputational demanding, low parallelizable, and ultimately inapplicable, sincebiological network of realistic size is a large system, which is characterised bya high density of interactions and often with a non-linear dynamics and anon-Euclidean latent geometry. Currently, graph embedding emerges as the newlearning paradigm that shifts the tasks of building complex models forclassification, clustering, and link prediction to learning an informativerepresentation of the graph data in a vector space so that many graph mining andlearning tasks can be more easily performed by employing efficient non-iterativetraditional models (e.g., a linear support vector machine for the classificationtask).

METHODS: Children'scognition was evaluated using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-FourthEdition (WISC-IV). Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data of 18 healthy children and22 BECTS patients were recorded in order to construct a functional connectivity(FC) network, which was quantified by graph theory (GT). RESULTS: The mean age ofthe control group was 7.94 +/- 1.89 years, and the mean age of BECTS patients was8.14 +/- 1.73 years. Our results show that the WISC-IV index scores in the BECTSgroup were significantly lower than those in the control group. Besides, the FCnetwork pattern of BECTS patients changed significantly in the 12-30, 30-80, and250-500 Hz frequency band. The local functional connections between posteriorcingulate cortex (PCC) and frontal lobe varied significantly in 12-30, 80-250,and 250-500 Hz. Our GT analysis shows that the connection strength of BECTSpatients increases significantly in the 12-30 Hz frequency band, the path lengthdecreases significantly in the 12-30 Hz and 30-80 Hz frequency bands, with theclustering coefficient decreasing significantly in the 12-30 Hz, 30-80 Hz, and250-500 Hz frequency bands. Correlation analysis showed that the full-scale IQ(FSIQ) was positively correlated with the 12-30 Hz clustering coefficient, verbalcomprehension index (VCI) was positively correlated with the 250-500 Hzclustering coefficient, perceptual reasoning index (PRI) was positivelycorrelated with the 12-30 Hz clustering coefficient, and perceptual reasoningindex (PSI) was negatively correlated with the 12-30 Hz path length.

This is especially thecase for the most common pediatric solid tumor of the sympathetic nervous system,namely, neuroblastoma (NB). Liquid biopsy is in principle a very promising toolfor this purpose, but usually enrichment and isolation of circulating tumor cellsin such patients remain difficult due to the unavailability of universal NBcell-specific surface markers. Here, we show that rapid screening and phenotypingof NB cells through stain-free biomarkers supported by artificial intelligence isa viable route for liquid biopsy. We demonstrate the concept through a flowcytometry based on label-free holographic quantitative phase-contrast microscopyempowered by machine learning. In detail, we exploit a hierarchical decisionscheme where at first level NB cells are classified from monocytes with 97.9%accuracy. Then we demonstrate that different phenotypes are discriminated withinNB class. Indeed, for each cell classified as NB its belonging to one of four NBsub-populations (i.e., CHP212, SKNBE2, SHSY5Y, and SKNSH) is evaluated thusachieving accuracy in the range 73.6%-89.1%. The achieved results solve therealistic problem related to the identification circulating tumor cell, i.e., thepossibility to recognize and detect tumor cells morphologically similar to bloodcells, which is the core issue in liquid biopsy based on stain-free microscopy.The presented approach operates at lab-on-chip scale and emulates real-worldscenarios, thus representing a future route for liquid biopsy by exploitingintelligent biomedical imaging.', metadata={'source': './file.csv', 'row': 87}), Document(page_content='The Research in the field of mental health and educational needs of children with intellectual disabilities has increased over the years.

Tumor response to molecular-targeted drugs and immune checkpointinhibitors is different from conventional chemotherapy in terms of temporalmetabolic alteration and morphological change after the therapy. Cancer stemcells, immunologically competent cells, and metabolism of cancer are consideredtargets of novel therapy. Accumulation of FDG reflects the glucose metabolism ofcancer cells as well as immune cells in the tumor microenvironment, which differsamong patients according to the individual immune function; however, FDG-PETcould evaluate the viability of the tumor as a whole. On the other hand, specificimaging and cell tracking of cancer cell or immunological cell subsets does notelucidate tumor response in a complexed interaction in the tumormicroenvironment.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: A general dataprotection regulation-compliant electronic survey was sent by e-mail to the 617radiologists registered in the French departments of Nord and Pas-de-Calais (93radiology residents and 524 senior radiologists), from both public and privateinstitutions. The survey included 42 questions focusing on AI in radiology, anddata were collected between January 16(th) and January 31(st), 2019. The answerswere analyzed together by a senior radiologist and a radiology resident. RESULTS:A total of 70 radiology residents and 200 senior radiologists participated to thesurvey, which corresponded to a response rate of 43.8% (270/617). One hundredninety-eight radiologists (198/270; 73.3%) estimated they had receivedinsufficient previous information on AI. Two hundred and fifty-five respondents(255/270; 94.4%) would consider attending a generic continuous medical educationin this field and 187 (187/270; 69.3%) a technically advanced training on AI. Twohundred and fourteen respondents (214/270; 79.3%) thought that AI will have apositive impact on their future practice. The highest expectations were thelowering of imaging-related medical errors (219/270; 81%), followed by thelowering of the interpretation time of each examination (201/270; 74.4%) and theincrease in the time spent with patients (141/270; 52.2%). CONCLUSION: Whilerespondents had the feeling of receiving insufficient previous information on AI,they are willing to improve their knowledge and technical skills on this field.They share an optimistic view and think that AI will have a positive impact ontheir future practice.

Pest managementis a major challenge for crop production that can benefit from machine learningtechniques to detect and monitor specific pests and diseases. Traditionalmonitoring is labor intensive, time demanding, and expensive, while machinelearning paradigms may support cost-effective crop protection decisions. However,previous studies mainly relied on morphological images of stationary orimmobilized animals. Other features related to living animals behaving in theenvironment (e.g., walking trajectories, different postures, etc.) have beenoverlooked so far. In this study, we developed a detection method based onconvolutional neural network (CNN) that can accurately classify in real-time twotephritid species (Ceratitis capitata and Bactrocera oleae) free to move andchange their posture. Results showed a successful automatic detection (i.e.,precision rate about 93%) in real-time of C. capitata and B. oleae adults using acamera sensor at a fixed height. In addition, the similar shape and movementpatterns of the two insects did not interfere with the network precision.
