 'passage: recognition of intellectual abilities of a patient is essential for good treatment. however, this may be hard to achieve, even by experiencedprofessionals. < br / > aim : to educate professionals how to detect and diagnoseintellectual impairment accompanied by an approximate knowledge on methods andpitfalls in establishing psychiatric diagnoses. < br / > method : several validinstruments for the screening of intellectual impairment in the netherlands aredescribed in conjunction with adjoining steps in the diagnostic process. < br / > results : to determine mild intellectual disability or borderline intellectualfunctioning by screening and testing intelligence and adaptive functioning, andby establishing an integrative diagnosis by including emotional as well as sociallevel of functioning. some pitfalls in the diagnostic process are discussed. < br / > conclusion : clinicians must be aware which tools to use to determine broadfunctioning of the patient and which further steps are necessary for a gooddiagnosis.']"
What is the connection between therapeutic angiogenesis and regeneration in the youngest organism?,"[""['The connection between therapeutic angiogenesis and regeneration in the youngest organism is that regeneration is considered a prerogative of the youngest organism. This means that the ability to regenerate is more prevalent in younger organisms, such as embryos and fetuses. Therefore, these models are being studied for their potential to be translated into clinical treatments for adults. The context also suggests that studying the natural experimentation and evolutionary process of regeneration in younger organisms may provide more reliable and translatable results compared to short-term human investigations.']""]","Therapeutic angiogenesis is a medical strategy that aims to enhance native revascularization responses in cardiovascular patients by using angiogenic growth factors or proangiogenic cells to accelerate tissue healing. The connection between therapeutic angiogenesis and regeneration in the youngest organism lies in the shift towards considering regeneration as a prerogative of the youngest organism, such as embryonic and fetal models. Scientists are exploring the potential of using lessons from mother nature and natural experimentation in understanding mechanisms governing repair and regeneration. This approach may lead to improved well-being in adulthood by capturing the secret of prolonged health span.","['passage: angiogenesis is a highly regulated process. it promotes tissue regeneration and contributes to tumor growth. existing therapeutic concepts interfere withdifferent steps of angiogenesis. the quantification of the vasculature is ofcrucial importance for research on angiogenetic effects. the chorioallantoicmembrane ( cam ) assay is widely used in the study of angiogenesis. ex ovo culturedchick embryos develop an easily accessible, highly vascularised membrane on thesurface. tumor xenografts can be incubated on this membrane enabling studies oncancer angiogenesis and other major hallmarks. however, there is no commonlyaccepted gold standard for the quantification of the vasculature of the cam. wecompared four widely used measurement techniques to identify the most appropriateone for the quantification of the vascular network of the cam. the comparison ofthe different quantification methods suggested that the cam assay application onthe ikosa platform is the most suitable image analysis application for thevasculature of the cam. the new cam application on the ikosa platform turned outto be a reliable and feasible tool for practical use in angiogenesis research. this novel image analysis software enables a deeper exploration of variousaspects of angiogenesis and might support future research on new anti - angiogenicstrategies for cancer treatment.'
 'passage: therapeutic angiogenesis is a relatively new medical strategy in the field of cardiovascular diseases. the underpinning concept is that angiogenic growthfactors or proangiogenic cells could be exploited therapeutically incardiovascular patients to enhance native revascularization responses to anischemic insult, thereby accelerating tissue healing. the initial enthusiasmgenerated by preclinical studies has been tempered by the modest success ofclinical trials assessing therapeutic angiogenesis. similarly, proangiogenic celltherapy has so far not maintained the original promises. intriguingly, thecurrent trend is to consider regeneration as a prerogative of the youngestorganism. consequentially, the embryonic and foetal models are attracting muchattention for clinical translation into corrective modalities in the adulthood. scientists seem to undervalue the lesson from mother nature, e. g. all humans areborn young but very few achieve the goal of an exceptional healthy longevity. either natural experimentation is driven by a supreme intelligence or stochasticphenomena, one has to accept the evidence that healthy longevity is the fruit ofan evolutionary process lasting million years. it is therefore extremely likelythat results of this natural experimentation are more reliable and translatablethan the intensive, but very short human investigation on mechanisms governingrepair and regeneration. with this preamble in mind, here we propose to shift thefocus from the very beginning to the very end of human life and thus capture thesecret of prolonged health span to improve well - being in the adulthood.'
