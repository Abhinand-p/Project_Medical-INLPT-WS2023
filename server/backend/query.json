The alarming increase in breast cancer cases emphasizes the managementof disease at multiple levels. The management should start from the beginningthat includes stringent cancer screening or cancer registry to effectivediagnostic and treatment strategies. Breast cancer is highly heterogeneous atmorphology as well as molecular levels and needs different therapeutic regimensbased on the molecular subtype. Breast cancer patients with respective subtypehave different clinical outcome prognoses. Breast cancer heterogeneity emphasizesthe advanced molecular testing that will help on-time diagnosis and improvedsurvival. Emerging fields such as liquid biopsy and artificial intelligence wouldhelp to under the complexity of breast cancer disease and decide the therapeuticregimen that helps in breast cancer management. In this review, we have discussedvarious risk factors and advanced technology available for breast cancerdiagnosis to combat the worst breast cancer status and areas that need to befocused for the better management of breast cancer., Title: Global Increase in Breast Cancer Incidence: Risk Factors and Preventive Measures., Authors: Kashyap, Dharambir|Pal, Deeksha|Sharma, Riya|Garg, Vivek Kumar|Goel, Neelam|Koundal, Deepika|Zaguia, Atef|Koundal, Shubham|Belay, Assaye,, Data of Publication: 2022, Journal Title: BioMed research international, Medical subject headings: Artificial Intelligence|*Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis/epidemiology/prevention & control|Early Detection of Cancer|Female|Humans|Incidence|Risk Factors, Context 1: PMID: 37055164, Abstract: BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in women; an estimated one in eight women in the USA willdevelop BC during her lifetime. However, current methods of BC screening,including clinical breast exams, mammograms, biopsies and others, are oftenunderused due to limited access, expense and a lack of risk awareness, causing30% (up to 80% in low-income and middle-income countries) of patients with BC tomiss the precious early detection phase. METHODS: This study creates a key stepto supplement the current BC diagnostic pipeline: a prescreening platform, priorto traditional detection and diagnostic steps. We have developed BREast CAncerRisk Detection Application (BRECARDA), a novel framework that personalises BCrisk assessment using artificial intelligence neural networks to incorporaterelevant genetic and non-genetic risk factors. A polygenic risk score (PRS) wasenhanced by employing AnnoPred and validated by fivefolds cross-validation,outperforming three existing state-of-the-art PRS methods. RESULTS: We used datafrom 97 597 female participants of the UK BioBank to train our algorithm. Usingthe enhanced PRS thus trained together with non-genetic information, BRECARDA wasevaluated in a testing dataset with 48 074 UK Biobank female participants andachieved a high accuracy of 94.28% and area under the curve of 0.7861. Ouroptimised AnnoPred outperformed other state-of-the-art methods on quantifyinggenetic risk, indicating its potential for supplementing the current BC detectiontests, population screening and risk evaluation. CONCLUSION: BRECARDA can enhancedisease risk prediction, identify high-risk individuals for BC screening,facilitate disease diagnosis and improve population-level screening efficiency.It can serve as a valuable and supplemental platform to assist doctors in BCdiagnosis and evaluation., Title: Early breast cancer risk detection: a novel framework leveraging polygenic risk scores and machine learning., Authors: Tao, Lynn Rose|Ye, Yixuan|Zhao, Hongyu,, Data of Publication: 2023 Oct, Terms or keywords associated with the article: genetic research|genetics|genetics, medical|genomics, Journal Title: Journal of medical genetics, Medical subject headings: Female|Humans|*Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis/epidemiology/genetics|Artificial Intelligence|Genetic Predisposition to Disease|Risk Factors|Machine Learning, "}}
