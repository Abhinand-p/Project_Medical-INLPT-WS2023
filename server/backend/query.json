Where appropriate, datawill be pooled using meta-analysis by applying the RevMan software version 5.1,considering the heterogeneity of studies. RESULTS: The review is in progress. Weplan to submit the results in the beginning of 2018. CONCLUSION: Providingtailored instruction to health professionals and students is a priority in orderto optimize learning and clinical outcomes. This systematic review willsynthesize the best available evidence regarding the effectiveness of AEEs inimproving knowledge, competence, and behavior in health professionals andstudents. It will provide guidance to policy makers, hospital managers, andresearchers in terms of AEE development, implementation, and evaluation inquery: healthcare.Chunk 1: p=0.009),and increased rates of mental distress (p=0.003), irritability (p<0.001) anddepressive-anxiety traits (p<0.05) in male deletion carriers relative to malecontrols completing the Mental Health Questionnaire. While academic attainmentwas unaffected, male and female deletion carriers exhibited impaired performanceon the Fluid Intelligence Test (Cohen\\'s d</=0.05, corrected p<0.1). Neuroanatomicalanalysis in female deletion carriers indicated reduced right putamen and leftnucleus accumbens volumes (Cohen\\'s d</=0.26, corrected p<0.1). CONCLUSION: Adultmales with XLI disease-causing deletions are apparently at increased risk ofcardiac arrhythmias and self-reported mood problems; altered basal gangliastructure may underlie altered function and XLI-associatedpsychiatric/behavioural phenotypes. These results provide information for geneticcounselling of deletion-carrying individuals and reinforce the need formultidisciplinaryquery: medical care.Chunk 2: was detected in six(1.6%) of 370 patients with low risk and 48 (7.6%) of 633 with high risk (oddsratio 4.98, 95% CI 2.11-11.75, p=0.0002). Compared with usual care, AI-guidedscreening was associated with increased detection of atrial fibrillation(high-risk group: 3.6% [95% CI 2.3-5.4] with usual care vs 10.6% [8.3-13.2] withAI-guided screening, p<0.0001; low-risk group: 0.9% vs 2.4%, p=0.12) over amedian follow-up of 9.9 months (IQR 7.1-11.0). INTERPRETATION: An AI-guidedtargeted screening approach that leverages existing clinical data increased theyield for atrial fibrillation detection and could improve the effectiveness ofatrial fibrillation screening.
