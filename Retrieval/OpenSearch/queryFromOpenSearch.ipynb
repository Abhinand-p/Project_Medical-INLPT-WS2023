20 % - 25 % attain the ability to walk ; language is nearly absent in most. neurologicfeatures may include axial hypotonia, hypertonia / spasticity of the extremities, and dystonia or other movement disorders. nearly 40 % have seizures by age tenyears. behaviors may include sleep disturbances, hand stereotypies, and selfbiting. micpch in males may occur with or without severe epileptic encephalopathyin addition to severe - to - profound developmental delay. when seizures are presentthey occur early and may be intractable. in individuals and families with milder ( i. e., hypomorphic ) pathogenic variants, the clinical phenotype is usually thatof xlid with or without nystagmus and additional clinical features. males havemild - to - severe intellectual disability, with or without nystagmus and otherocular features. females typically have normal intelligence with some displayingmild - to - severe intellectual disability with or without ocular features. diagnosis / testing : the diagnosis of a cask disorder is established in a femalewho is heterozygous for a cask pathogenic variant and in a male who is hemizygousfor a cask pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. rarely, affectedmales have a mosaic pathogenic variant. management : treatment of manifestations : treatment is symptomatic and includes standard management of developmental delayand intellectual disability issues ;
