## Introduction
In an era dominated by vast amounts of scientific literature, accessing and comprehending relevant information poses a significant challenge for researchers and professionals. Our project addresses this issue by implementing a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system connected to GPT-3.5, a state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI. This system aims to facilitate the extraction and synthesis of information from articles containing 'Intelligence' hosted on PubMed, a widely used database of biomedical literature.

The primary objective of our project is to provide an intuitive and efficient means for users to query articles stored from PubMed and receive comprehensive and contextually relevant answers to their questions. By leveraging the capabilities of GPT-3.5 and integrating it with a retrieval mechanism, we empower users to pose natural language queries and obtain synthesized responses tailored to their information needs.

In this report, we provide an overview of our project, including its motivation, methodology, and implementation details. We outline the key concepts and techniques employed in our approach, offering insights into how the integration of GPT-3.5 and PubMed enhances the information retrieval and synthesis process. Furthermore, we present the results of our experiments and evaluations, showcasing the effectiveness and performance of our RAG system. Finally, we discuss potential applications, limitations, and future directions for extending and refining our approach to meet evolving user needs and technological advancements.



"""The first section should explain what your project is all about, why the project and underlying
problems are interesting and relevant, and it should outline the rest of your report. The
introduction also outlines the key ideas of your approach without going into the details in
terms of realization and implementation. It is also possible to give an outlook of the results
the reader can expect to see in the later sections."""
## Related Work
This section of your report covers core prior work related to your project, and puts your work
into the context of current research. This includes papers that you used as a basis for your
approach or papers that used the same techniques as you did but applied them to a different
problem. In this section, you should emphasize how your work differs from previous work,
e.g., by outlining the limitations of previous work, or why your application domain is
different from those other researchers have already investigated. However, you should not go
into all the details about any of the work you cite, instead, you should outline how the major
points of previous work relate to your project.
## Methods/Approach
This section gives all the conceptual details of the system you developed and is intended for
readers who want to fully understand your system, its functionality, and its components. This
includes the (data) processing pipelines you realized, the algorithms you developed, and all
other key methods you designed during the project.Here’s some advice for this section:.
● Be specific about your methods. In this section, you can show your detailed
understanding of the matter. Include equations where necessary and show figures,
such that the reader can better follow and understand your approach.
● If some part of your work is original or especially creative, make it clear, such that the
reader (e.g., your mentor) can understand the novelty of your approach. You do not
need to show any false modesty in this part of your work. If you use any existing
methods, however, you need to recognize and properly cite them. Be consistent
throughout your report and stick to a fixed vocabulary before writing. This includes
mathematical terms and notations, method names, names for data sets, and the like.
Only a few things are more irritating than changing naming and writing conventions
during a report.
● If you have any baseline approaches, they should also be described. This can be
detailed if you created the baseline yourself or just briefly if there is an external
source from which you took the baseline.

## Experimental Setup and Results
This section needs to cover the following information:
● Data: Describe the data you used for the project. Outline where, when, and how you
have gathered the dataset. Providing a clear understanding of the data can be very
helpful for readers to follow your analysis. If you have any interesting or insightful
metrics of your data, this is the place to show them.
● Evaluation Method: Be clear about how you are going to evaluate your project. Do
you use an existing quantitative metric? Or did you define your evaluation metric? If
you use your method, be sure to motivate what you try to achieve with it, and what it
does reflect. In any case, define your evaluation metric, be it a qualitative or
quantitative one, automatic or human-defined.
● Experimental Details: If your methods rely on configurable parameters, specify
them, such that your results are replicable. Explain why you chose the parameters in
that way (e.g., did you do some grid search?).
● Results: The results section of your report highly depends on your project. If you
have a baseline to which you can compare your approach, you obviously should do
this. In such cases, tables and plots are suitable means to present your achievements.
In any case, use the evaluation metrics defined before. Moreover, comment on your
results: are they in line with your expectations? Or are they better or worse? What are
the potential reasons for this?
● Analysis: You can include some qualitative analysis in this section. Does your system
work as expected? Are there cases in which your approach consistently succeeds in
the task, or surprisingly fails? If you have a baseline, you can also compare if they
succeed and fail in the same contexts or if your approach may be suitable for other
applications than the baseline. Underpin your points using examples or metrics
instead of stating unproven claims.

## Conclusion and Future Work
Recap the main contributions of your project. Highlight your achievements, but also reflect
on the limitations of your work. Potentially, you can also outline how your model can be
extended or improved in the future, or you can briefly give insights into what you have
learned during the project.
## References
List your references at the end of your report. You can add them as a list at the end of your
report and refer to the author's name and year in the text, e.g., [Gertz et al.
2020](#link-to-the-bib-section). Make sure you follow proper citation methods and include
all author's names, the name of the journal or conference, the full title of the paper, and the
publication year.
